# AI Agent Architecture

The evaluation pipeline contains 6 specialized C-Suite AI agents divided into two functional councils:

## 1. Strategic Council

### 💼 CFO Agent (Chief Finance Officer)
*   **Key Focus:** Financial viability, revenue generation potential, operational cost reduction, and business ROI.
*   **Database Key:** `business`
*   **Persona Prompt:** Critique the financial viability of this idea. Evaluate its potential for revenue generation, cost saving, and operational ROI. Give a score from 0-100 indicating financial return and viability.

### ⚖️ CCO Agent (Chief Compliance Officer)
*   **Key Focus:** Regulatory alignment, policy adherence, legal constraints, IP, and licensing compliance.
*   **Database Key:** `innovation`
*   **Persona Prompt:** Audit this idea for regulatory alignment, policy adherence, legal constraints, intellectual property issues, and licensing compliance. Give a score from 0-100 indicating safety from compliance risks.

### 🎯 CGO Agent (Chief Growth Officer)
*   **Key Focus:** User acquisition, customer delight, onboarding friction, and market-facing scalability.
*   **Database Key:** `customerImpact`
*   **Persona Prompt:** Assess user acquisition, customer delight, onboarding friction, retention impact, and market-facing scalability. Give a score from 0-100 on customer and market growth impact.

---

## 2. Execution Council

### 🛠️ ChEO Agent (Chief Engineering Officer)
*   **Key Focus:** Technical feasibility, infrastructure, scaling limitations, and development complexity.
*   **Database Key:** `feasibility`
*   **Persona Prompt:** Critically analyze technical feasibility, architecture requirements, infrastructure impact, scaling limitations, and development complexity. Give a score from 0-100 representing technical ease of implementation.

### 👥 CHRO Agent (Chief Human Resources Officer)
*   **Key Focus:** Employee productivity, workflow disruption, change management, training, and cultural fit.
*   **Database Key:** `employeeImpact`
*   **Persona Prompt:** Evaluate how this idea impacts employee workflow, organizational culture, change management, training timelines, and employee productivity. Give a score from 0-100 on organizational synergy.

### 🛡️ CSO Agent (Chief Security Officer)
*   **Key Focus:** Security posture, data privacy implications (GDPR/PII), vulnerability exposure, and threat surface.
*   **Database Key:** `security`
*   **Persona Prompt:** Evaluate the security posture, data privacy implications (GDPR/PII), vulnerability exposure, and threat surface. Give a score from 0-100 representing the strength of security risk mitigation.

---

# Scoring Engine

Formula:

The weighted consensus score is calculated from the individual C-Suite evaluation scores:

```typescript
finalScore =
  CFO (business) * 0.25 +
  ChEO (feasibility) * 0.20 +
  CHRO (employeeImpact) * 0.15 +
  CCO (innovation) * 0.15 +
  CSO (security) * 0.15 +
  CGO (customerImpact) * 0.10;
```

---

# Similarity Detection

Workflow:

New Idea

↓

Tokenize Title & Description (remove stopwords)

↓

Load Existing Ideas

↓

Calculate Jaccard Similarity + Title Match Bonus

↓

Return Similar Ideas (>15% threshold, ranked by score)

Thresholds:

- **≥ 50% similarity:** Critical duplicate warning (strongly suggest merging)
- **≥ 30% similarity:** Potential similar ideas warning
- **> 15% similarity:** Listed as related ideas

Implementation: `src/lib/ai/similarity.ts` — lightweight, zero-dependency token-based engine.
